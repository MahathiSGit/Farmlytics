 Farmlytics
                                 A QGIS plugin
 Farmlytics is a QGIS plugin designed to enhance agricultural analysis through intuitive visualization and comparison of farm-level NDVI data. Select farms, view their NDVI trends across growing cycles, and explore key phenological markers like SOS, EOS, and peak NDVI. Interact with feature tables and plots to make informed decisionsâ€”all within the QGIS environment.
